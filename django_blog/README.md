## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. **Authentication**  
   Users can register, log in, and access their profile.  
2. **Blog Post CRUD**  
   - All users can view posts.  
   - Authenticated users can create posts.  
   - Only post authors can edit or delete their own posts.  
3. **Comment System (Class-Based)**  
   - Comments are displayed under each post.  
   - Authenticated users can add comments with `CommentCreateView`.  
   - Comment authors can edit with `CommentUpdateView`.  
   - Comment authors can delete with `CommentDeleteView`.  
4. **Search**  
   - The search bar is available on all pages.  
   - Users can enter keywords to find posts by title or content.  
   - Results are displayed in `search_results.html`.  
5. **Tags**  
   - Posts can have multiple tags.  
   - Tags are displayed as clickable links under each post.  
   - Clicking a tag filters posts by that tag and displays them in `tag_posts.html`.  
6. **Template Inheritance**  
   All pages extend from `base.html` for a consistent layout.  
7. **Static Files**  
   CSS styling is applied globally via Djangoâ€™s `{% static %}` system.

## âœ… Deliverable Notes
- No new CSS was added; all templates use the **existing global styling**.  
- Blog post, comment, search, and tag systems are fully integrated with authentication and permissions.  
- Templates (`base.html`, `post_list.html`, and `post_detail.html`) updated for search and tag features.  
- Tested for security: only authors can modify their content.
