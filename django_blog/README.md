- **templates/blog/** â†’ HTML templates for authentication, posts, and comments  
- **static/css/** â†’ Global stylesheet (`styles.css`)  
- **django_blog/** â†’ Project settings and URL configurations

## ðŸŽ¨ Styling
- A single CSS file (`styles.css`) is used for the entire project.  
- It provides:
  - Page layout reset  
  - Header and footer styling  
  - Navigation bar design  
  - Simple clean look for forms, posts, and comments  

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. **Authentication**  
   Users can register, log in, and access their profile.  
2. **Blog Post CRUD**  
   - All users can view posts.  
   - Authenticated users can create posts.  
   - Only post authors can edit or delete their own posts.  
3. **Comment System**  
   - Comments are displayed under each post.  
   - Logged-in users can add comments.  
   - Authors of comments can edit or delete them.  
   - Permissions prevent unauthorized editing/deletion.  
4. **Template Inheritance**  
   All pages extend from `base.html` for a consistent layout.  
5. **Static Files**  
   CSS styling is applied globally via Djangoâ€™s `{% static %}` system.  

---

## âœ… Deliverable Notes
- No new CSS was added; all templates use the **existing global styling**.  
- Blog post and comment systems are fully integrated with authentication and permissions.  
- Templates and URLs are logically structured for easy navigation.  
- Tested for security: only authors can modify their content.
